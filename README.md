# Sleeep-Learn-Succeed* **

--- WHERE THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT CAME FROM ---

I was thinking about another interesting idea for a project to work on, something new and unique.

It reminded a scene from an old comedy movie where the hero had to learn some material overnight, 
but he was so tired and was falling asleep while reading a book. He would go for rest till the morning, 
but his relative was so strict with him and pushed him to read the book anyway. And the hero was so 
smart that he ask his relative to help him and read the book to him while he is sleeping, he was joking but 
sounded seriously that it is possible to learn like that as well. When he went to the class and was asked to 
answer some questions regarding the material he had to read, he failed...

--- WEBSITE ---

That movie scene gave me an idea to imagine a technology that could help to learn while you are sleeping. 
I called it "Sleep.Learn.Succeed" or "SLS-1" (where "1" is the first device model, more to be developed). 
The website was developed for a potential customer, who is interested in this solution and would like to 
place a pre-order for the device which is going to be released for the mass sales soon. Imagined manufacturing 
and developing company (SLS Technology Inc.) is based in Winnipeg. The website offers potential customers to 
learn more about the product and technology. The company has partnerships with the Universities* in North America 
and promotes "SLS-1" device and the techology through the Education industry with more and the most interested 
potential customers- students and people who are actively learning and willing to learn and succeed faster.

--- IS THAT TRUE? ----

*The website idea and the information are the results of my imagination and are not true.

I would wish this technology is true and available nowadays. I would run for the SLS-1 to use it myself for sure.

More interesting projects are under development at the moment and will be coming soon :)

Thank you for your time reviewing my code.

Respectfully,
Oleg.
